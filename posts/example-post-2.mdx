  Showcase of a tiny Android app I made and why

## Motivation

I created quick select save to solve one specific problem I was having. The Toronto public library gives me access to O'Rielly Books online for free but only through their web browser. That means no ability to bookmark, highlight, or add annotations. All things I use constantly when reading techincal books.

Techincally I could select text with a long press, then copy, go to another note taking app, then paste. But this context switching is annoying and slow. I would like a way to save text without having to leave the app or webpage I am reading from. (Or at least it should not feel like I am leaving the app).

## Extra Motivation

Google also sent me an email saying that if I didn't publish and app in 30 days they would delete my account. Although it would only cost me around $25 to renew when I did want to publish more apps. I might as well save myself that time and money.

## The technology

I decided to do this in native Kotlin code using Room to store all the notes
